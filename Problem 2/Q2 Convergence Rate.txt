Quadratic FEM Errors: Any[0.9070929547791448, 0.7791489406653183, 0.7413104985461023, 0.7330858518451261]
Convergence rates: Any[0.21935126162973165, 0.07182119436801407, 0.016095780601478312]
Average Convergence rate: 0.10242274553307468

Convergence rate is ~ .10 which indicates a convergence rate slower than we would want for quadratic FEM (~2).
